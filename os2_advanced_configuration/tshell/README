INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

TSHELL is a text-based, non-graphical user interface shell for OS/2 2.1.
TSHELL can start multiple full-screen sessions and run programs in them.

TSHELL is not for everybody.  TSHELL sacrifices the usability of PM and the
Workplace Shell, but it does save memory.  TSHELL works well in 4MB.

Every TSHELL session is a full-screen session.  These can be OS/2, DOS, or
WINOS2 sessions depending on the machine configuration.  As always, you use
Alt-Esc to switch around sessions and Ctrl-Esc to show a list of sessions.

There is no Presentation Manager; thus, PM applications will not work.
There are other restrictions; see below.  TSHELL may have applications in
low-resource systems, embedded systems, floppy boots, or test beds.

TSHELL is IBM Employee Written Software.  Please read the "as-is" license
agreement from IBM.  Essentially, you use this program "as is," and IBM
makes no warranty about the correctness of this program or its suitability
to any purpose.

TSHELL is written by Monte Copeland, IBM Boca Raton.

INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make a copy of your CONFIG.SYS.  You will need it to uninstall TSHELL.

2. Copy TSHELL.EXE into the root directory of the bootup drive.

3. Edit CONFIG.SYS and change the PROTSHELL setting to

            PROTSHELL=\TSHELL.EXE

There is more you can do to save memory.  See below.

4. (OPTIONAL) Copy PGMSHELL.EXE into your PATH.







RESTRICTIONS AND KNOWN BUGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

TSHELL will not run programs that require Presentation Manager.  TSHELL
does not initialize PM.  It can only start OS/2 and DOS programs in full
screen sessions.

TSHELL does not spool.  If you have no printer attached, and you
accidentally press Print-Screen, you should wait for the parallel port to
timeout:  up to two minutes.  See SetParallelTimeout() function below for a
workaround.

REXX works (if present) but REXX utilities DLL (REXXUTIL.DLL) does not.

The START /DOS command does not work right.  CMD.EXE should start a DOS
session, but it incorrectly starts an OS/2 session.  Get my STARTDOS
package (STARTD.ZIP) for a workaround.

At this time, IBM LAN Requestor does not work.  Fix in progress.

When TSHELL has a shutdown option on the menu, end all running programs
first, then it works.

When TSHELL does not have a shutdown option on the menu, press
Control-Alt-Delete and wait for the disk activity light to go out.  Then
turn off the computer.  This is a clean shutdown.  C-A-D will always
perform a clean shutdown and reboot.

TSHELL has no means to kill a session.  Working on it.

Pressing Ctrl-Esc from WinOS2 on Dell S3 SVGA causes video sync problems.
Keep pressing Alt-esc to recover.

The running list can get corrupted.  Keep pressing Alt-Esc to recover.
This happens on ThinkPads if you close and reopen them.

In DOS sessions, NumLock and CapsLock lamps on the keyboard do not light
properly.  The lamps are refreshed correctly after a session switch.

If running MEMMAN=NOSWAP, you must ensure you have enough memory.  Problems
will occur upon exceeding memory capacity.  TSHELL operates most reliably
with swapping turned on.

Don't run TSHELL from a command prompt.  TSHELL.EXE is for the PROTSHELL
statement in CONFIG.SYS.









PGMSHELL.EXE: PROGRAMMING THE TSHELL START LIST
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage: PGMSHELL <REXX cmd file>

You can modify TSHELL's list of startable programs by writing a script in
REXX and invoking it via the utility PGMSHELL.EXE.  PGMSHELL collects data
from REXX and passes it to TSHELL.

PGMSHELL is optional.  If you never use PGMSHELL, TSHELL will provide a
default list of items to start.  PGMSHELL requires REXX.

Here is a sample REXX program that modifies the TSHELL start list:

    /* REXX program to modify TSHELL */

    if 'PGMSHELL' <> address() then do
      say 'Expected PGMSHELL environment.'
      say 'Usage:  PGMSHELL <cmd filename>'
      return 2
    end

    /* TSHELL does not spool, so reduce parallel port timeout
    from 120 to 5 seconds in case you accidentally hit print-screen
    and there is no printer hooked up. */
    rc = SetParallelTimeout( "LPT1", 5 )

    /* title text for the start list  */
    rc = SetStartTitle( "Start Group" )

    /* title text for the running list  */
    rc = SetRunningTitle( "Running Group" )

    /* Add OS2 program; arguments: title, startup dir, parameters, exe */
    /* I omit the title of CMD.EXE session, then CMD.EXE will dynamically */
    /* update the title based on the currently-running program. */
    rc = AddOS2Program( "",,,"CMD.EXE" )

    /* Add OS2 program; arguments: title, startup dir, parameters, exe */
    rc = AddOS2Program( "Format Floppy",,"A:","FORMAT.COM" )

    /* is configured for DOS? */
    if QueryDOSCapable() then do
      /* Add DOS program;
      arguments: title, startup dir, parameters, settings stem */
      drop settings
      settings.0 = "DPMI_DOS_API=ENABLED"
      settings.1 = "DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT=8"
      rc = AddDOSProgram( "DPMI DOS Session",,, "settings" )

      /* Add winos2 */
      rc = AddDOSProgram( "WinOS2","","/c winos2", "" )
    end

    /* add shutdown option. arguments: title, completion msg */
    rc = AddShutdown( "Shutdown", "Shutdown Complete" )
    return 0



These special functions are available to REXX programs under the PGMSHELL
environment:


SetParallelTimeout( portname, timeout in decimal seconds )
   Sets the parallel port timeout. Set the port timeout to zero if there
   is no printer attached.

SetStartTitle( start group title )
   Sets the title text above the list of startable programs.

SetRunningTitle( running group title )
   Sets the title text above the list of running programs.

QueryDOSCapable()
   Returns a Boolean indicating if the system is configured to emulate DOS.

AddOS2Program( title, startup dir, parameters, EXE )
   Adds an OS/2, protected-mode program to the start list.

AddDOSProgram( title, startup dir, command.com arguments, settings stem )
   Adds a DOS mode program to the start list. ALL elements of the stem
   variable are considered DOS settings. Therefore, drop the stem variable
   before assigning DOS settings to it.  For help with DOS settings,
   1) see the settings dialog in Workplace Shell or 2) obtain my
   STARTDOS package and run settings.exe, a PM application.

AddShutdown( shutdown title, shutdown complete message )
   Adds the shutdown option to the start group.

USING LESS DISK AND MEMORY WITH TSHELL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section suggests ways to reduce the amount of disk space and
memory required for OS/2 when running with TSHELL.  Think carefully before
you delete OS/2 system files.  Experiment with a subset of OS/2 DLLs in a
directory other than \OS2\DLL.  When you find the right subset, then erase
the rest as you see fit.

OS/2 2.1 can boot from a single floppy.  See the BOOT2X.ZIP package
in the OS2USER forum library 17 on CompuServe.

Here are two configurations:  one with DOS support; one without.  It
assumes the boot drive is drive C:, and there is a VGA display installed.

Step 1:  Create new directories for your subset of OS/2 DLLs.  Begin by
copying DLLs from \OS2\DLL into C:\DLL and C:\DLL\DLL as shown.

Directory C:\DLL is required for both DOS and non-DOS operation.

Three REXX DLLs can reside in either C:\DLL or C:\DLL\DLL.  Or, omit them
if you don't use REXX.


Step 2: Modify CONFIG.SYS.  Here are two sample CONFIG.SYS files.
The directory C:\BIN contains only user executables.

FOR NON-DOS, OS2-ONLY OPERATION:  Get VTBL850.DCP from OS/2 Installation
Disk 1 and copy to C:\OS2.  Note this LIBPATH ignores C:\DLL\DLL created in
step one.  Sample CONFIG.SYS:

   rem CONFIG.SYS for no DOS, protect-mode-only operation
