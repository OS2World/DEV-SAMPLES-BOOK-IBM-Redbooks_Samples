INSTALLING, BUILDING AND EXECUTING SOMBANK

        The SOMBank sample application described in this
        document is shipped on a diskette which is
        provided with this document.  This appendix will
        describe how to install, build, configure and run
        the SOMBank application on OS/2, AIX and Windows
        systems.
       
        All of the required source and the executables are
        included on the diskette.  Therefore, the
        application may be executed without having to
        build it first.  Makefiles are included which will
        allow you to rebuild the executables from the
        source if so desired.

                    executable is identically named and functionally
                    equivalent to the OS/2 version.
 
    INSTALLATION

                    Before going through the following sections,
                    please familiarize yourself with the DSOM
                    configuration requirements as discussed in
                    the redbook and Chapter 6 of the
                    SOMobjects Developer Toolkit Users Guide.

        SOMBANK INSTALLATION ON OS/2

                    The following instructions assume that the entire
                    SOMBank application will execute on a single OS/2
                    workstation.  "Installing SOMBank for Cross
                    System Execution"  will discuss what must
                    change if this assumption is not correct.
 
                    1.  From the diskette, copy the contents of the
                       "\COMMON" and "\OS2" subdirectories to an
                       appropriate directory on your system.
                       Assuming you will use the directory
                       "c:\sombank" for this application and that you
                       currently have a directory called "c:\tools"
                       that is specified in your PATH environment,
                       execute the following commands.
         
                              copy a:\common\c_idl.pak c:\sombank
                              copy a:\os2\bankos2.pak c:\sombank
                              copy a:\os2\mergedef.exe c:\tools
                              cd c:\sombank
                              unpack bankos2.pak
                              unpack c_idl.pak

                   2.  Add the SOMBank class interface definitions to
                       the Interface Repository:

                       a.  Ensure the SOMIR environment variable is
                           set appropriately, for example:

                              set SOMIR=C:\SOM\ETC\SOM.IR;C:\SOMBANK\SOM.IR

                       b.  Execute the command

                                 sc -sir -u *.idl

                   3.  Add the appropriate DSOM server definitions to
                       the Implementation Repository:

                       a.  Ensure the SOMDDIR environment variable is
                           set appropriately.  If using workgroup
                           DSOM, this should be set to a directory on
                           a shared file system.

                       b.  By default, the "bankreg" command will
                           register all servers as being located on
                           the local host.  Modify the contents of
                           this file if one or more servers will be
                           located on other systems.  Instructions
                           for modifying this file are included
                           within the file itself.  Execute the
                           "bankreg" command.

                   4.  Check that all appropriate environment
                       variables are set as discussed in the documentation.
                       These include:

                       -   HOSTNAME
                       -   USER
                       -   SOMDDIR
                       -   SOMIR

                   You may use the SOM toolkit supplied "irdump" and
                   "regimpl" utilities to ensure that the SOMBank
                   information has been added to the Interface
                   Repository and Implementation Repository.  You are
                   now ready to execute SOMBank as described in
                   "Executing SOMBank".

        SOMBANK INSTALLATION ON AIX

                   The following instructions assume that the entire
                   SOMBank application will execute on a single AIX
                   workstation.  "Installing SOMBank for Cross
                   System Execution"  will discuss what must
                   change if this assumption is not correct.

                   1.  From the diskette, copy the contents of the
                       "\AIX" subdirectory to an appropriate
                       directory on your system.  The following
                       examples will assume the directory is
                       "/sombank".

                   2.  Rename the "'BANKAIX.TRZ'" file to
                       "'bankaix.tar.Z'".  For example, use the
                       command:

                            mv BANKAIX.TRZ bankaix.tar.Z

                   3.  Uncompress this file by executing the
                       following command:

                              uncompress bankaix.tar.Z

                   4.  Use the "tar" command to restore the original
                       files by executing the command:
                 
                              tar -xvf bankaix.tar
                 
                   5.  Add the SOMBank class interface definitions to
                       the Interface Repository:
                 
                       a.  Ensure the SOMIR environment variable is
                           set appropriately. For example:
                 
                               export SOMIR=/usr/lpp/som/etc/som.ir:/sombank/som.ir
                 
                       b.  Execute the command
                 
                                 sc -sir -u *.idl
                 
                   6.  Add the appropriate DSOM server definitions to
                       the Implementation Repository:
                 
                       a.  Ensure the SOMDDIR environment variable is
                           set appropriately.  If using workgroup
                           DSOM, this should be set to a directory on
                           a shared file system.
                 
                       b.  By default, the "bankreg" command will
                           specify that all servers will be located
                           on the local host.  Modify the contents of
                           this file if one or more servers will be
                           located on other systems.  Execute the
                           "bankreg" command.
                 
                   7.  Check that all appropriate environment
                       variables are set as discussed in the documentation.
                 
                       -   HOSTNAME
                       -   USER
                       -   SOMDDIR
                       -   SOMIR
                 
                   You may use the SOM toolkit supplied "irdump" and
                   "regimpl" utilities to ensure that the SOMBank
                   information has been added to the Interface
                   Repository and Implementation Repository.  You are
                   now ready to execute SOMBank as described in 
                   "Executing SOMBank".

        SOMBANK INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS

                   The following instructions assume that the entire
                   SOMBank application will execute on a single
                   Windows workstation.  "Installing SOMBank
                   for Cross System Execution" will discuss
                   what must change if this assumption is not
                   correct.

                   | UNPACKed on an OS/2 system before copying them |
                   | to a Windows system.                           |
                   |                                                |

                   From the diskette, copy the contents of the
                   "\COMMON" and "\WIN" subdirectories to an
                   appropriate directory on an OS/2 system.  Assuming
                   you will use the directory "c:\temp" for this
                   step,execute the following commands:

                         copy a:\common\c_idl.pak c:\sombank
                         copy a:\win\bankwin.pak c:\temp
                         copy a:\win\mergedef.exe c:\temp
                         cd c:\temp
                         unpack bankwin.pak
                         unpack c_idl.pak

                   Copy the contents of the "\temp" subdirectory to
                   your Windows system.  The 'mergedef.exe' utility
                   should be copied to a separate directory where you
                   normally place useful utilities such as a "\tools"
                   directory.  This directory should be specified in
                   your PATH  environment.

                   The following steps are most easily accomplished
                   from a normal DOS prompt.  Windows does not need
                   to be active for the following installation steps
                   unless otherwise specified.  For the purposes of
                   an example commands, we will assume the directory
                   where you have copied the SOMBank files is
                   "C:\SOMBANK".

                   1.  Add the SOMBank class interface definitions to
                       the Interface Repository:

                       a.  Ensure the SOMIR environment variable is
                           set appropriately, for example:

                              set SOMIR=C:\SOM\ETC\SOM.IR;C:\SOMBANK\SOM.IR

                       b.  From the "\SOMBANK" directory execute the
                           following command:

                                 somc -sir -u *.idl

                   2.  Add the appropriate DSOM server definitions to
                       the Implementation Repository:

                       a.  Ensure the SOMDDIR environment variable is
                           set appropriately.  If using workgroup
                           DSOM, this should be set to a directory on
                           a shared file system.

                       b.  By default, the "bankreg" command will
                           register all servers as being located on
                           the local host.  Modify the contents of
                           this file if one or more servers will be
                           located on other systems.  Instructions
                           for modifying this file are included
                           within the file itself.  Execute the
                           "bankreg" command.

                   3.  Check that all appropriate environment
                       variables are set as discussed in -- Heading
                       'DSOMCL' unknown --.  These include:

                       -   HOSTNAME
                       -   USER
                       -   SOMDDIR
                       -   SOMIR

                   4.  At this point, start Windows if it is not
                       already active.  Create a new program group
                       called SOMBank.

                   5.  From the SOMobjects Toolkit group, copy the
                       ICON representing the DSOM Daemon into the
                       SOMBank group.  Modify the working directory
                       property of the DSOM Daemon to specify


                      "C:\SOMBANK". The working directory will be
                       the location where the SOMBank database files
                       will be created.

                       The working directory will also be the
                       location searched for part of the Interface
                       Repository if an explicit path is not
                       specified in the SOMIR environment variable.

                   6.  Create two new program items in the SOMBank
                       group for starting the ADMINWIN.EXE and
                       ATMWIN.EXE client programs.  Ensure the
                       directory information is properly filled in.
                   
                   7.  You may also find it useful to copy the
                       SOMEND, REGIMPL and IRDUMP icons from the
                       SOMobjects Toolkit group to the SOMBank group.
                       Now you will be able to access all SOM
                       utilities and the SOMBank application icons
                       from within the SOMBank group window.

                  You may use SOM toolkit supplied "IRDUMP" and
                  "REGIMPL" utilities to ensure that the SOMBank
                  information has been added to the Interface
                  Repository and Implementation Repository.  You are
                  now ready to execute SOMBank as described in 
                  "Executing SOMBank".

        INSTALLING SOMBANK FOR CROSS SYSTEM EXECUTION

                  When running SOMBank in a workgroup DSOM
                  environment with components running on different
                  systems, the steps indicated above should be
                  followed for each system where a component of
                  SOMBank will execute.

                  -   Ensure that the DSOM workgroup enabler is
                      installed on all systems that will participate
                      and that all systems will be using the same
                      communications protocol.

                  -   If a shared file system will be used for the
                      Interface Repository, then ensure the SOMIR
                      environment variable is set on the various
                      systems to point at the shared directory and
                      file.  Otherwise, the Interface Repository
                      should be populated on each system as
                      discussed in the previous installation
                      instructions.

                  -   For SOMBank, the Implementation Repository
                      must be on a shared file system.  Ensure the
                      SOMDDIR environment variable is set
                      appropriately on the various systems involved.
                      You will only need to execute "bankreg" from
                      one system.  However, before executing
                      "bankreg", you must manually modify the
                      "bankreg" command (script) file to be used by
                      adding the host names of the various server
                      machines.  This requires adding a parameter to
                      each "regimpl"  statement in the "bankreg"
                      command file to specify the host name of the
                      target host.  An example of this modification
                      is included in the various "bankreg" files.

                      Though not detailed here, the systems must be
                      configured to resolve the host names.  This is
                      normally done through a "HOSTS" file.  Please
                      refer to the SOMobjects Workgroup Enabler
                      Installation/Configuration Guide to ensure all
                      necessary steps have been taken.

                  -   Execute the "bankreg" command.


                  -   Ensure the appropriate transport protocol
                      stack is installed and that the SOMSOCKETS
                      environment variable is set to indicate the
                      protocol stack to be used.  This environment
                      variable is typically set to one of:

                           TCPIPSockets
                           NBSockets
                           IPXSockets

    EXECUTING SOMBANK

                  Ensure all of the installation steps described
                  above have been properly completed.  You may want
                  to utilize the "irdump" and "regimpl" commands to
                  verify that Interface Repository and the
                  Implementation Repository have been successfully
                  populated and are accessible from each system.

                  Start "somdd" on each system where a server
                  process will exist.  You will normally want to
                  ensure that "somdd" is started from the same
                  subdirectory where the SOMBank files are located.

                  When the clients described below are started, the
                  ServerBroker server, a Central server and the
                  CentralDBServer server processes will be
                  automatically initialized.  It may take sometime
                  for these server processes to completely
                  initialize, which will result in a noticeable
                  delay to the user.  Once a branch server is
                  required by the client, two additional servers
                  will be started ( a Bxxx server and the
                  BxxxDBserver).  Again, there may be a noticeable
                  delay at the client while these servers are
                  started.  Once the servers are started, subsequent
                  transactions should be much faster.  For each
                  concurrent client that is started, a new Central
                  and Bxxx server will be started.  In addition, if
                  a single client needs access to account data
                  stored in a second branch, a new Branch DB Server
                  will also be started.

                  Recall, that savings accounts will earn interest
                  (at the rate of 5% compounded such that one minute
                  is equivalent to one day).  Also, checking
                  accounts will be charged a 20 cent transaction fee
                  for each transaction when the balance drops below
                  $500.

        EXECUTING OS/2 CLIENTS

                  There are two versions of each of the clients on
                  OS/2.  "'ADMIN.EXE'" is a text-based
                  administrative client for adding customers and
                  account information to the database.
                  "'ADMINPM.EXE'" is a PM version of the client.
                  Likewise, the ATM function is provided by
                  "'ATM.EXE'" and "'ATMPM.EXE'".

                  After installation, there are no customers in the
                  database.  Therefore, the administrative client
                  should be used first to add customers to the
                  database.  When a customer is added, its ID and
                  other information will be presented to the user.
                  The customer ID should be remembered for future
                  access to this customers accounts.  (The ID's are
                  four digit values starting with 0001 and are
                  sequentially allocated.  In our simplified
                  environment, the PIN will be identical to the ID).

                  In the PM version, the administrator may select
                  the branch associated with each customer.  With
                  the text-based version, the "'ADMIN.EXE'" program
                  may be started with a parameter signifying the
                  branch that will be used for all account activity
                  for the duration of the clients execution.  The
                  default branch ID is B001.  If an administrator
                  using the text-based client wishes to add accounts
                  to branch B002, then the following command would
                  be used to start the "ADMIN" client:

                        admin B002

                  Once accounts have been added to the database, the
                  ATM clients may be started to provide customer
                  access to the accounts for inquiry, withdrawal and
                  deposits.  By exiting the administrative client
                  before starting the ATM, new server processes will
                  not need to be created.  The ServerBroker will
                  re-assign the already created server processes
                  that have been freed by the administrative client
                  to the ATM client.

        EXECUTING AIX CLIENTS

                  The two text-based clients for AIX are called
                  "admin.exe" and "atm.exe"

                  It is recommended to start the client programs
                  from a different session then that used to start
                  "somdd".  Otherwise, various status and error
                  messages generated by the classes in the server
                  will appear in the same session as the client
                  output.  Even during normal operation, some
                  exceptions and error messages are generated.
                  Having these appear in the client session will
                  cause confusion for the user.

                  After installation, there are no customers in the
                  database.  Therefore, the administrative client
                  should be used first to add customers to the
                  database.  When a customer is added, its ID and
                  other information will be presented to the user.
                  The customer ID should be remembered for future
                  access to this customers accounts.  (The ID's are
                  four digit values starting with 0001 and are
                  sequentially allocated.  In our simplified
                  environment, the PIN will be identical to the ID).

                  The "admin.exe" program may be started with a
                  parameter signifying the branch that will be used
                  for all account activity for the duration of the
                  client's execution.  The default branch ID is
                  B001.  If an administrator wishes to add accounts
                  to branch B002, then the following command would
                  be used to start the "admin.exe" client:

                        admin.exe B002

                  Once accounts have been added to the database, the
                  ATM clients may be started to provide customer
                  access to the accounts for inquiry, withdrawal and
                  deposits.  By exiting the administrative client
                  before starting the ATM, new server processes will
                  not need to be created.  The ServerBroker will
                  re-assign the already created server processes
                  that have been freed by the administrative client
                  to the ATM client.

        EXECUTING WINDOWS CLIENTS

                  The two clients on Windows are called
                  "ADMINWIN.EXE" and "ATMWIN.EXE".

                  | The "ATMWIN.EXE" program was written using     |

                  After installation, there are no customers in the
                  database.  Therefore, the administrative client
                  should be used first to add customers to the
                  database.  When a customer is added, its ID and
                  other information will be presented to the user.
                  The customer ID should be remembered for future
                  access to this customers accounts.  (The ID's are
                  four digit values starting with 0001 and are
                  sequentially allocated.  In our simplified
                  environment, the PIN will be identical to the ID).

                  Once accounts have been added to the database, the
                  ATM clients may be started to provide customer
                  access to the accounts for inquiry, withdrawal and
                  deposits.  By exiting the administrative client
                  before starting the ATM, new server processes will
                  not need to be created.  The ServerBroker will
                  re-assign the already created server processes
                  that have been freed by the administrative client
                  to the ATM client.

  BUILDING SOMBANK

                  The diskette includes platform and compiler
                  specific makefiles for building SOMBank.  These
                  files will build all of the class libraries and
                  clients for the specific platform.

                  On OS/2 and Windows there is one additional
                  utility file that is called by the makefile.  This
                  utility is called "'MERGEDEF.EXE'".  There are two
                  versions of this utility, one for OS/2 and one for
                  Windows.  They should be copied into a separate
                  directory that is specified in the PATH
                  environment variable.  This utility merges
                  multiple .DEF files as emitted from the SOM
                  compiler into a single .DEF file.  It is used when
                  building the "'customer.dll'" and "'account.dll'"
                  files.  It can be used for other projects as well,
                  when there is a requirement to merge the DEF files
                  generated from multiple IDL files when including
                  multiple classes in one DLL.  These .DEF files can
                  be merged manually if required and this process is
                  described in the SOMobjects Developer Toolkit
                  Users Guide. However, this utility simplifies the
                  process and allows the entire SOMBank application
                  to be built in one step.

                  The AIX environment does not require the use of
                  the "mergedef" utility.

                  To build the entire SOMBank application execute
                  the following commands:

                        nmake /f makefile.os2        (for OS/2)

                        nmake /f mafeile.win         (for Windows)

                        make                         (for AIX)

                  Each makefile also includes a "clean" option which
                  will erase the executables, bindings files and
                  other files generated by the make or nmake
                  process.

                  The makefiles will also automatically create a
                  local "'som.ir'" file including information about
                  all of the SOMBank classes.  However, in some
                  cases a default som.ir (usually 32 bytes in size)
                  is generated and may have a date later than the
                  IDL files supplied by SOMBank.  In this case, the
                  "'som.ir'" file may not be generated by the make
                  or nmake process.  It is always a good idea to
                  verify that the "'som.ir'" file has been properly
                  populated before attempting to execute the SOMBank
                  application.  When properly populated, a
                  "'som.ir'" file containing only SOMBank class
                  interface definitions is around 30 Kilobytes in
                  size.

  RESETTING THE APPLICATION

                  There are two aspects of the SOMBank environment
                  that you may wish to reset periodically.

        RESETTING THE IMPLEMENTATION REPOSITORY

                  If SOMBank is not ended normally, then over time
                  the Implementation Repository may grow and the
                  file "'svrbrokr.dat'" which holds the persistent
                  data relating to the ServerBroker may get out of
                  sync in relation to the Implementation Repository.
                  Whenever changes are made manually to the
                  Implementation Repository that affect the SOMBank
                  related servers, the "'svrbrokr.dat'" file should
                  be erased.  Other than a slight performance hit
                  during initial server contact, erasing the
                  "'svrbrokr.dat'" file will not hurt the operation
                  of the SOMBank application.  Therefore, we
                  recommended you erase this file periodically to
                  reset the ServerBroker data.

                  If the application starts failing for no apparent
                  reason, it is possible that the "'svrbrokr.dat'"
                  file has either filled up (it has a maximum of
                  fifty entries) or the Implementation Repository
                  has had entries removed that the ServerBroker
                  believes are still there.  In such a case, it is
                  best to erase and rebuild the Implementation
                  Repository and erase the "'svrbrokr.dat'" file.

                  The "'svrbrokr.dat'" file is created in the
                  working directory of the ServerBroker server
                  process.  This will typically be the current
                  directory when "somdd" is started.  Therefore,
                  "somdd"  should consistently be started from the
                  same location or else this file will not be
                  properly located on subsequent SOMBank executions.

        RESETTING THE DATABASES

                  The customer and account databases are ultimately
                  stored in flat files with the following names:

                      CentralD.BIN
                      BxxxDBSe.ACC
                      BxxxDBSe.FEE
                      BxxxDBSe.INT

                  where xxx indicates the branch ID. (For example,
                  'B001DBSE.ACC'

                  These files may be erased to remove all customer
                  and account information.  They will be
                  automatically created the first time a customer is
                  added to the database.

                  The database files will be created in the working
                  directory of the database servers' processes.
                  This will typically be the current directory when
                  "somdd" is started.  Therefore, "somdd" should
                  consistently be started from the same location or
                  else the database files from previous executions
                  may not be found which will result in lost
                  customer and account data.
